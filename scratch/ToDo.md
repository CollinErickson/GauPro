# GauPro to do

* Plot kernels

* Factor kernel: example

* Ordered factor kernel: example

* Ignore input kernel: example

* Take in data/formula input in addition to matrix

* Calculate EI

* Change print, summary

* Cool1Dplot uses nugget, but shouldn't, too jumpy

* dC of factor kernels need to be times s2?

* Improve kernel model plot

* Predict mean vs value?

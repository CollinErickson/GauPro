# GauPro to do

* Factor kernel: example

* Ordered factor kernel: example

* Ignore input kernel: example

* Take in data/formula input in addition to matrix

* Calculate EI

* Change print, summary

* Cool1Dplot too jumpy

* Improve kernel model plot

* Predict mean vs value?

* progress bar for restarts

* Fewer restarts in high dim

* Give kernel in as string. If missing, give better error or just use Mat52.

* Reduce L-BFGS-B tolerance? Need to change tests too.

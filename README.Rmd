# GauPro

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CollinErickson/GauPro.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CollinErickson/GauPro)

This package allows you to fit a Gaussian process to a dataset. 
A Gaussian process is a commonly used model in computer simulation.
It assumes that the distribution of any set of points is multivariate
normal with a constant mean and a correlation function.

This package only fits a simple GP model and only works with the 
Gaussian correlation function.

You should probably use a different package for your modeling,
such as laGP, mlegp, or GPfit if you are using R, or GPy if you
are using Python.

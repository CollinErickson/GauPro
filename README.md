[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CollinErickson/GauPro.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CollinErickson/GauPro)

This package allows you to fit a Gaussian process to a dataset. A Gaussian process is a commonly used model in computer simulation. It assumes that the distribution of any set of points is multivariate normal with a constant mean and a correlation function.

This package only fits a simple GP model and only works with the Gaussian correlation function.

You should probably use a different package for your modeling, such as laGP, mlegp, or GPfit if you are using R, or GPy if you are using Python.
